# Row Level Security (RLS) Fix Summary

## Problem

You were getting the error: **"new row violates row-level security policy for table 'properties'"**

## Root Cause

Your Supabase database has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with policies that require authenticated users:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated insert access" ON properties
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

However, your client-side code was using the browser Supabase client, which sometimes doesn't properly pass authentication context to the database for RLS checks.

## Solution

We created **Server Actions** to handle all property database operations. Server Actions run on the server side and have proper access to authentication context through cookies.

### Files Created/Modified

#### 1. New File: `src/app/admin/properties/actions.ts`

This file contains three server actions:

- `createProperty()` - Creates a new property
- `updateProperty()` - Updates an existing property
- `deleteProperty()` - Deletes a property

Each action:

- Uses the server-side Supabase client with proper cookie handling
- Verifies the user is authenticated before performing operations
- Includes proper error handling
- Revalidates Next.js cache after mutations

#### 2. Updated: `src/app/admin/properties/create/page.tsx`

- Removed direct Supabase client usage
- Now uses the `createProperty()` server action
- Simplified error handling

#### 3. Updated: `src/app/admin/properties/edit/[id]/page.tsx`

- Removed direct Supabase update calls
- Now uses the `updateProperty()` server action
- Maintains the same UI/UX

## Why This Works

1. **Server-Side Authentication**: Server Actions run on the server and have direct access to authentication cookies, ensuring `auth.uid()` is properly set.

2. **Proper Cookie Handling**: The server Supabase client is created with `cookies()` from Next.js, which properly passes authentication state.

3. **Security**: Server Actions are more secure as they run server-side and can't be manipulated from the browser.

4. **Next.js 15 Best Practice**: Using Server Actions is the recommended approach in Next.js 15 for database mutations.

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Make sure you're logged in to the admin panel
2. Try creating a new property
3. The property should now save successfully without RLS errors
4. Try editing an existing property
5. Changes should save without issues

## Additional Notes

- The server actions automatically handle cache revalidation using `revalidatePath()`
- Authentication is verified in each action before performing database operations
- Error messages are properly returned to the client for display
- The slug uniqueness is now handled in the `createProperty` action (adds random suffix)

## If You Still Get Errors

If you still experience RLS errors:

1. **Verify you're authenticated**: Check if you can access the admin dashboard
2. **Check browser console**: Look for any authentication-related errors
3. **Clear cookies**: Try logging out and back in
4. **Check Supabase Dashboard**: Verify your RLS policies are active and correct
5. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set correctly

## Alternative Solution (If Still Having Issues)

If the problem persists, you could temporarily modify the RLS policy to be less restrictive:

```sql
-- For testing only - allow all authenticated users to insert
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated insert access" ON properties
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);  -- Less restrictive
```

However, this is **not recommended for production** as it bypasses security checks. The Server Actions approach is the proper solution.
