# Subcategory Filter Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented subcategory filtering for properties based on Home, Plots, and Commercial categories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`src/types/property.ts`)

- Added `subCategory?: string` field to the `SearchFilters` interface
- This allows the filter to track which subcategory is selected

### 2. Updated Search Sidebar (`src/components/search-sidebar.tsx`)

- Imported `propertyTypes` from `@/components/Admin/PropertyForm`
- Added `handleSubCategoryChange` function to toggle subcategory selection
- Added new UI section that displays subcategory chips based on selected property type:
  - **Homes**: House, flat/appartment, Upper Portion, Lower Portion, Farm House, Room, Penthouse
  - **Plots**: Residential Plot, Commercial Plot, Agricultural Land, Industrial Land, Plot File, Plot Form
  - **Commercial**: Office, Shop, Warehouse, Factory, Building, Other
- Subcategory section only shows when a main category (homes, plots, or commercial) is selected
- Subcategories are hidden for "apartments" and "all" filters
- When property type changes, subcategory is automatically reset

### 3. Updated Explore Page (`src/app/(site)/explore/page.tsx`)

- Added `subCategory: undefined` to initial filter state
- Updated `handleClearFilters` to reset subcategory
- Added subcategory to active filters count check
- Added visual chip display for selected subcategory in the active filters section
- Subcategory chip is displayed with a secondary color to differentiate from main category

### 4. Updated Property Filtering Logic (`src/lib/supabase/properties.ts`)

- Modified `getFilteredProperties` function to handle subcategory filtering
- When a subcategory is selected:
  - Uses `ilike` query to match the specific property type
  - Only filters by that specific subcategory instead of all types in the category
- When no subcategory is selected:
  - Filters by all property types in the selected category (existing behavior)

## User Experience

### Filter Flow

1. User selects a main property type (Homes, Plots, or Commercial)
2. Subcategory chips appear below the main type selection
3. User can click a subcategory to filter further
4. Clicking the same subcategory again deselects it
5. Changing the main property type resets the subcategory selection
6. Active filters are displayed as chips showing both main category and subcategory

### Visual Feedback

- Selected subcategories use a gradient background with shadow effect
- Unselected subcategories have a hover effect with scale animation
- Active filter chips show at the top with icons for easy identification
- Main category chips use primary color, subcategory chips use secondary color

## Technical Details

### Filter State Management

```typescript
interface SearchFilters {
  propertyType: "all" | "homes" | "apartments" | "plots" | "commercial";
  subCategory?: string; // New field
  priceRange: [number, number];
  beds?: number;
  baths?: number;
  minArea: number;
  maxArea: number;
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

### Database Query Logic

- Subcategory filter uses case-insensitive matching (`ilike`)
- Works seamlessly with existing price, area, beds, baths filters
- Maintains real-time updates through Supabase subscriptions

## Benefits

1. **More Precise Filtering**: Users can narrow down to specific property types
2. **Better UX**: Clear visual hierarchy between main categories and subcategories
3. **Flexible**: Can select just main category or drill down to subcategories
4. **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile layouts
5. **Consistent**: Integrates smoothly with existing filter system

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test selecting different property types and their subcategories
2. Verify subcategory resets when changing main property type
3. Test combination filters (subcategory + price + beds/baths)
4. Verify mobile filter drawer displays subcategories correctly
5. Test clearing filters removes both category and subcategory
