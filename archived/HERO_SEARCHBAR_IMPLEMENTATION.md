# Hero Search Bar & Apartments Filter Fix - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Apartments Filter in Explore Page

**File:** `src/app/(site)/explore/page.tsx`

#### Issue:

- URL parameter "apartments" (with typo) wasn't being handled correctly
- Filter needed to check `property_type` field instead of just matching the URL param

#### Solution:

- Updated filter initialization to handle both "apartments" and "apartments" URL parameters
- Modified the `useEffect` hook to properly map URL parameters to the "apartments" filter
- Added search parameter support from URL query string

```typescript
// Now handles both spellings
typeParam === "apartments" || typeParam === "apartments" ? "apartments" : "all";
```

### 2. Created Hero Search Bar Component

**File:** `src/components/Home/Hero/SearchBar.tsx`

#### Features:

- ✅ Property type filters (All, Homes, Apartments, Plots, Commercial)
- ✅ Search input for location/property name
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- ✅ Interactive buttons with active states
- ✅ Navigate to explore page with filters applied
- ✅ Keyboard support (Enter key to search)

#### Design:

- Glass morphism effect with backdrop blur
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Icons for each property type
- Primary color for active states
- Fully responsive grid layout

### 3. Updated Hero Section

**File:** `src/components/Home/Hero/index.tsx`

#### Changes:

- Imported and integrated `HeroSearchBar` component
- Removed old category buttons
- Added search bar to mobile view (below hero text)
- Added search bar to desktop view (right column)
- Maintains responsive layout

#### Layout:

- **Mobile:** Search bar appears below the hero text and description
- **Desktop:** Search bar appears in the right column (2-column grid)

## URL Parameters Supported

### Property Type Filters:

- `/explore?type=homes` - Shows all home types
- `/explore?type=apartments` - Shows apartments (handles typo)
- `/explore?type=apartments` - Shows apartments (correct spelling)
- `/explore?type=plots` - Shows all plot types
- `/explore?type=commercial` - Shows commercial properties
- `/explore` - Shows all properties

### Search Query:

- `/explore?search=location` - Filters by search term
- `/explore?type=homes&search=islamabad` - Combines filters

## Property Type Mapping

The filter correctly maps URL parameters to database property types:

- **homes** → `["house", "flat", "upper portion", "lower portion", "farm house", "room", "penthouse", "apartment"]`
- **apartments** → `["flat", "apartment", "penthouse"]`
- **plots** → `["residential plot", "commercial plot", "agricultural land", "industrial land", "plot file", "plot form", "plot"]`
- **commercial** → `["office", "shop", "warehouse", "factory", "building", "other"]`

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Apartments filter works with "apartments" URL param

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

3. Add recent searches feature
4. Add filter presets (e.g., "Luxury Homes", "Budget Plots")
5. Add location-based filtering with map integration

## Files Modified

2. `src/components/Home/Hero/SearchBar.tsx` - New search bar component
3. `src/components/Home/Hero/index.tsx` - Integrated search bar into hero section

## Notes

- The search bar uses client-side navigation for instant response
- All filters maintain state through URL parameters
- The component is fully typed with TypeScript
- Design follows the existing project's design system
