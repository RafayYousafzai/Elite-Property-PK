# Search Query Display Fix - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Issue Reported

When users selected filters (like "plots") and entered a search query in the Hero SearchBar, then clicked "Search Properties", the search input field on the explore page was empty - it wasn't displaying the search query from the URL parameters.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Value Prop on Search Input

**File:** `src/app/(site)/explore/page.tsx`

The `Input` component on the explore page didn't have a `value` prop bound to `filters.searchQuery`, so it couldn't display the URL search parameter.

**Before:**

```tsx
<Input
  startContent={<Search className="h-5 w-5 text-slate-400" />}
  fullWidth
  size="lg"
  placeholder="Search by location, name, or property type..."
  onValueChange={(value) => handleSearchChange(value)}
  className="h-12"
/>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<Input
  startContent={<Search className="h-5 w-5 text-slate-400" />}
  fullWidth
  size="lg"
  value={filters.searchQuery} // ✅ Added this line
  placeholder="Search by location, name, or property type..."
  onValueChange={(value) => handleSearchChange(value)}
  className="h-12"
/>
```

### 2. Apartments Filter Not Working

**Files:**

- `src/app/(site)/explore/page.tsx`
- `src/components/Home/Hero/SearchBar.tsx`

The URL parameter uses "appartments" (with typo), but the filter logic was only checking for "apartments" (correct spelling). This caused the apartments filter to not work.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Search Input Display (explore/page.tsx)

✅ Added `value={filters.searchQuery}` prop to the search Input component
✅ Now the search query from URL parameters automatically populates the input field

### 2. Fixed Apartments Filter (explore/page.tsx)

✅ Updated initial state to handle both "appartments" and "apartments" URL parameters
✅ Updated useEffect to handle both spellings
✅ Both URL params now correctly map to "apartments" filter type

```typescript
// Handles both spellings
typeParam === "appartments" || typeParam === "apartments"
  ? "apartments"
  : "all";
```

### 3. Updated Hero SearchBar (SearchBar.tsx)

✅ Changed apartments button value from "apartments" to "appartments"
✅ Maintains consistency with existing URL structure

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **Hero Page:** User selects "Plots" and types "Islamabad"
2. **Clicks Search:** Redirected to `/explore?type=plots&search=Islamabad`
3. **Explore Page:**
   - ✅ Search input automatically shows "Islamabad"
   - ✅ Plots filter is automatically applied
   - ✅ Active filter chips show the selections
   - ✅ Results are filtered correctly

### Supported URLs:

- `/explore?type=plots&search=islamabad` - ✅ Works
- `/explore?type=appartments` - ✅ Works (with typo)
- `/explore?type=apartments` - ✅ Works (correct spelling)
- `/explore?search=location` - ✅ Works
- `/explore?type=homes&search=lahore` - ✅ Works

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Search query displays in input field from URL
- [x] Property type filter applied from URL
- [x] Combined filters (type + search) work together
- [x] Apartments filter works with "appartments" URL param
- [x] Apartments filter works with "apartments" URL param
- [x] Active filter chips display correctly
- [x] Search input is editable and updates filters
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Responsive design maintained

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/(site)/explore/page.tsx`
   - Added `value` prop to search Input
   - Added "appartments" URL parameter handling (2 locations)
2. `src/components/Home/Hero/SearchBar.tsx`
   - Changed apartments value to "appartments"

## Technical Details

### State Management:

- URL params are the source of truth
- `filters.searchQuery` is synced with URL `search` param
- Input component displays `filters.searchQuery` value
- Changes to input update both state and URL

### Filter Logic:

```typescript
// Initial state
searchQuery: searchParam || ""

// URL sync
if (searchParam !== null) {
  updates.searchQuery = searchParam;
}

// Display in input
<Input value={filters.searchQuery} ... />
```

## Benefits

✅ Better user experience - filters persist across navigation
✅ Shareable URLs with pre-applied filters
✅ Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
✅ Input field shows current filter state
✅ Consistent with URL-driven architecture
