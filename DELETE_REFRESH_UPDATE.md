# Property Delete Auto-Refresh Implementation

## What Was Done

Updated the property deletion functionality to automatically refresh the properties table when a property is deleted.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `DeletePropertyButton.tsx`

- **Changed from client-side Supabase** to **Server Action** (`deleteProperty`)
- **Added `onDelete` callback prop** to notify parent component when deletion succeeds
- Maintains existing confirmation flow (click once to confirm, click again to delete)
- Shows loading state during deletion
- Calls both:
  - `onDelete()` callback for instant UI update
  - `router.refresh()` for server-side data refresh

### 2. Updated `PropertiesList.tsx`

- **Added `handleDeleteProperty` function** that removes the deleted property from local state
- **Passes the callback** to `DeletePropertyButton` component
- Provides instant visual feedback by removing the property from the list immediately
- Also fixed image src access to use `property.images[0]?.src`

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Delete" button → Confirmation appears
2. User clicks "Confirm" → Server action runs
3. **Instant UI update**: Property removed from list immediately via callback
4. **Server refresh**: Router refreshes to ensure server data is in sync
5. Property count updates automatically

## Benefits

✅ **Instant feedback** - Property disappears immediately  
✅ **Dual update strategy** - Both client state and server state refresh  
✅ **No page reload required** - Smooth user experience  
✅ **Secure** - Uses server actions with authentication checks  
✅ **Consistent** - Matches the create/edit pattern with server actions

## Testing

To test:

1. Go to `/admin/properties`
2. Click "Delete" on any property
3. Click "Confirm"
4. Property should disappear immediately from the table
5. Property count should update
6. If only property left, "No properties found" message should appear

## Code Flow

```
User clicks Delete
    ↓
Confirmation shown (3 sec timeout)
    ↓
User clicks Confirm
    ↓
DeletePropertyButton calls deleteProperty() server action
    ↓
Server Action:
  - Verifies authentication
  - Deletes from database
  - Revalidates cache paths
  - Returns success/error
    ↓
On Success:
  - onDelete() callback fires → removes from local state (instant)
  - router.refresh() fires → fetches fresh server data
    ↓
Table updates automatically
```
